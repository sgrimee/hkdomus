# hkdomus

Homekit bridge for Lifedomus home automation server, using the [hc](https://github.com/brutella/hc) and [godomus](https://github.com/sgrimee/godomus) libraries.

This is work in progress, not very useful yet ;-)

## Configuration

Parameters like server url, user, password can be given on the command line or saved in a configuration file. By default this is $HOME/.ldclient.yaml
See [ldclient_template.yaml](ldclient_template.yaml) for an example you can adapt and rename.

## Installation

## Usage

## TODO
- parse command line flags
- get devices from more than one hardcoded room
- fix ctrl+c to exit (use ctrl+\ for now)
